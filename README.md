# NotePad

My Goal was to create a Note to able to write and save notes. A note that organized what I wanted to say and to keep track of what I needed to complete. I had to use routes using GET and POST request and for extra credit we used a delete request.

I learned GET and POST request using express the build a webiste. Also how to deploy a website using Heroku.
